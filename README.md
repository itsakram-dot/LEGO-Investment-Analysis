# LEGO-Investment-Analysis
This project examines whether LEGO sets can act like alternative investments. Using data from LEGO sets released in 2018–2019, we explore which sets offer the best value and build a model to predict “fair price.” The goal: help investors make decisions based on analytics, not guesswork.
