## Overview
This project takes a comprehensive approach to LEGO set valuation through two distinct analytical lenses: descriptive analysis of historical patterns and predictive modeling of fair market prices. Using 2018-2019 LEGO set data, we answer both "what has happened" and "what should happen" to guide investment decisions.

## Business Problem
- LEGO sets can appreciate after retirement, but predicting winners is challenging
- Investors need both historical context AND forward-looking price guidance
- This project delivers both: market intelligence + predictive signals

## Part 1: Descriptive Analysis - Understanding the LEGO Market Landscape
**Goal:** Identify historical patterns, theme performance, and value indicators across the LEGO ecosystem.

**Methods & Findings:**
- **Theme Distribution Analysis:** Mapped set concentration across themes (Star Wars, City, etc.)
- **Value Efficiency Metrics:** Calculated price-per-brick ratios across categories
- **Pricing Pattern Recognition:** Identified licensing premiums and theme-specific pricing strategies

**Key Insights:**
- Largest themes don't guarantee best value-per-brick
- *Architecture* and *Creator Expert* themes show superior piece efficiency
- Licensed themes command price premiums beyond raw material value

## Part 2: Predictive Modeling - Estimating Fair Market Value
**Goal:** Build machine learning models to predict what LEGO sets *should* cost based on their attributes.

**Technical Approach:**
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression (baseline) vs. Random Forest (advanced)
- **Features:** Piece count, weight, theme, price category, licensing status
- **Validation:** Cross-validation, holdout testing, RÂ² > 0.95 accuracy

**Business Application:**
- Identifies undervalued sets (retail price < predicted fair price)
- Flags overpriced sets for risk avoidance
- Provides quantitative foundation for investment decisions

## How the Two Parts Work Together
The descriptive analysis informs *which types* of sets to consider, while the predictive modeling identifies *specific sets* within those categories that represent good value.

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Descriptive Filter:** Focus on *Creator Expert* themes (based on Part 1 findings)
2. **Predictive Screen:** Identify which *Creator Expert* sets are undervalued (using Part 2 model)
3. **Investment Decision:** Target the intersection of promising themes + undervalued sets

## Tools & Methodology
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA and visualization
- **Predictive Modeling:** Scikit-learn for machine learning, statistical validation
- **Business Intelligence:** Translating technical findings into actionable investment theses

## Business Value
- **Part 1 Value:** Strategic market understanding and theme selection framework
- **Part 2 Value:** Tactical set-specific valuation and pricing signals
- **Combined Value:** Comprehensive analytical approach from market-level to asset-specific

## Next Steps
- Expand descriptive analysis to include secondary market trends
- Enhance predictive model with resale price data and time-series features
- Build integrated dashboard showcasing both descriptive insights and predictive recommendations
